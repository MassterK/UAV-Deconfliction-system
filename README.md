# FlytBase UAV Strategic Deconfliction System

## Overview
This project implements a strategic deconfliction system for drones operating in shared airspace. It ensures a primary drone's mission is conflict-free in both space and time relative to other scheduled drone missions.

## Features
- Conflict detection in 2D space + time
- Adjustable safety buffer
- Conflict explanation (location, time, conflicting drone)
- Matplotlib-based visualizations
- Modular and testable Python code

## How to Run
```bash
python main.py

## Output

- close 2D spacial view to access 4D view
